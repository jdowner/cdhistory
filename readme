This script is used to record the frequency of visits to particular directories
through using the 'cd' function. The point is to use this information to provide
context aware tab completion from the command line based upon the most commonly
visited directories.

To incorporate this functionality, first make sure that cdhistory.py is
available on your path and is executable. I like to create a symlink from the
version in the repo to home/jdowner/bin, where it is called 'cdhistory'. Then
add the following snippet to your .bash_profile or wherever you keep such
things,

  function __cd(){
      cdhistory -a $1
      cd $1
  }

  alias cd='__cd'

This replaces the existing 'cd' function in bash with a wrapped version.
