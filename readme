This script is used to record the frequency of visits to particular directories
through using the 'cd' function. The point is to use this information is to use
this information to provide context aware tab completion from the command line
based upon the most commonly visited directories.

To incorporate this functionality, first make sure that cdhistory.py is
available on your path and is executable. I like to create a symlink from the
version in the repo to home/jdowner/bin, where it is called 'cdhistory'. Then
add the following snippet to your .bash_profile or wherever you keep such
things,

  function __cd(){
      cd $1 && cdhistory $1
  }

  alias cd='__cd'

This replaces the existing 'cd' function in bash with a wrapped version. Note,
that the new directory is only passed to cdhistory is the cd function succeeds;
so accidentally typing cd snrgk does not mean that a non-existant directory
witll be add to the .cdhistory file.
